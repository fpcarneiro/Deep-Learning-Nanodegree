### Convolutional Neural Network

#### Really Cool Resources on Visualizing CNN

If you would like to know more about interpreting CNNs and convolutional layers in particular, you are encouraged to check out these resources:
* Here's a [section](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/) from the Stanford's CS231n course on visualizing what CNNs learn.
* Check out this [demonstration](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/what-neural-nets-see) of a cool [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) app that visualizes CNNs in real-time, from user-supplied video!
* Here's a [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkfIQ4IGaM&amp;t=78s) of another visualization tool for CNNs. If you'd like to learn more about how these visualizations are made, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghEmQSxT6tw&amp;t=5s).
* Read this [Keras blog post](https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html) on visualizing how CNNs see the world. In this post, you can find an accessible introduction to Deep Dreams, along with code for writing your own deep dreams in Keras. When you've read that:
  * Also check out this [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XatXy6ZhKZw) that makes use of Deep Dreams (look at 3:15-3:40)!
  * Create your own Deep Dreams (without writing any code!) using this [website](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/).
* If you'd like to read more about interpretability of CNNs:
  * Here's an [article](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/) that details some dangers from using deep learning models (that are not yet interpretable) in real-world applications.
  * There's a lot of active research in this area. These [authors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) recently made a step in the right direction.
  
### RNN

#### LSTM
Now that you've gone through the Recurrent Neural Network lesson, I'll be teaching you what an LSTM is. This stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks, and are quite useful when our neural network needs to switch between remembering recent things, and things from long time ago. But first, I want to give you some great references to study this further. There are many posts out there about LSTMs, here are a few of my favorites:

* [Chris Olah's LSTM post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
* [Edwin Chen's LSTM post](http://blog.echen.me/2017/05/30/exploring-lstms/)
* [Andrej Karpathy's lecture on RNNs and LSTMs from CS231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX5V1WpxxkY)
