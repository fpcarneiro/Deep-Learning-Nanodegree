#### Really Cool Resources on Visualizing CNN

If you would like to know more about interpreting CNNs and convolutional layers in particular, you are encouraged to check out these resources:
* Here's a [section](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/) from the Stanford's CS231n course on visualizing what CNNs learn.
* Check out this [demonstration](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/what-neural-nets-see) of a cool [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) app that visualizes CNNs in real-time, from user-supplied video!
